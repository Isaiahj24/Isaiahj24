<p>Iron Man and Captain America fought together as allies against multiple enemies, but due to the relationship Captain America has with Bucky who is a wanted fugitive, Captain America and Iron Man will butt heads.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why this civil war started. First, it was the damage of public property where many of the battles took place. Then (spolier alert) in the comics there was an incident wher 500 school children died due to a mutant with explosive powers destroying a school. Iron Man wanted to monitor mutants by having them registered, Captain America disagreed, the rest was history. </p>
