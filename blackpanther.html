<p>T'Challa was born a prince in Wakanda, a small nation in Africa. This nation is enriched with vibranium which and was distributed across the globe. Vibranium is the metal that makes up Captain America's shield and one of Iron Man's suits. In the movie adaptation, it is rumored that he joins Iron Man because Bucky, Captain America's long time friend, killed his father. This rumor is false because Klaw, T'Challa's rival, killed his father over negotiations about Wakanda's resources. However inspite of this Black Panther's true motives remain unclear.</p>
